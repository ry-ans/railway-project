# 🚦 Railway Level Crossing Safety System  

**University of Canberra – 2025 S2 Assignment 1**  
*Railway Project – Truth Tables, Flowcharts, and Logic Circuits*  


## 🎯 Learning Goals  
This project demonstrates:  
- Applying logic-based design to a **real-world safety problem**.  
- Using **truth tables, flowcharts, and logic circuits** to model system behaviour.  
- Considering **constraints and stakeholders** in engineering design.  
- **Testing and refining** systems using different input/output scenarios.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps / Possible Extensions  
- Expand truth table to include **manual overrides** and **failures**.  
- Implement a **simulated controller** in Python/Arduino to mimic sensor inputs and gate outputs.  
- Integrate with a small hardware model (LEDs for signals, servo for boom gate).

## 👨‍💻 About This Repository  
This repository was created as part of an **Engineering Assignment** in Semester 2, 2025.  
It documents the full workflow from **problem analysis → solution design → testing → refinement**.  

The project showcases how engineering logic can improve **railway crossing safety**, and how AI (GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT) can be used to **improve documentation and clarity**.
