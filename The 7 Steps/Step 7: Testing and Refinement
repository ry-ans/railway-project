STEP 7:

Proposing 4 different test cases.

Test case 1
First one technically possible, just a very dire situation. 
Testing it highlights that the flow chart doesn’t consider emergency situations.

Test case 2
A potentially dysfunctional moment where there is something on the tracks, yet the gates are up. 
Testing shows the flow could be better represented as the situation didn’t originally include a train, rather a vehicle on the tracks.

Test case 3
Another ordinary moment where nothing is going on but the system is functioning. 
Testing confirms everything is in the clear, but may need to include a loop in case the situation changes.

Test case 4
A possibly dysfunctional moment where a train is coming and the boom gate isn’t coming down to prevent cars from passing. 
However, it could technically be okay, it may just be the moment that the train is recognised by the sensors and the gate is about to come down. 
Testing would infer that the gate should be down regardless.
