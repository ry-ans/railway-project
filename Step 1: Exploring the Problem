STEP 1:

Part 1) Every transportation system relies on rules to allow for safe travel from one place to another. Without these rules and processes, catastrophic failure would ensue. The logic-based safety system that is required to control and operate the gates at a railway level crossing is an example of where rules are required. This safety system needs to be fully operational so that if either a train is approaching or if a vehicle is stuck on the tracks, the gates are positioned to be down. If neither of these situations are present, then the gates can be raised.

Inputs and Outputs:
Input - Train oncoming from either side of the tracks
Input - Vehicle detection on either side when a vehicle is approaching the crossing
Input - Vehicle still on tracks
Output - Boom gates and hazard lights
Context:

This safety system is designed to be implemented at a level railway-crossing where both vehicles and trains have to intersect and cross paths. It creates a safer and automated way to overlap the two transportation methods and reduce accidents.

Constraints:

Technical - If a technical failure occurs under any condition, ensure that it defaults to the safest position which is to have the boom gates down.
Economic - Low maintenance cost, budget-friendly to implement, long expected life
Social - Needs to be easily understood with road markings and signage for the public
Environmental - Must not have a negative effect on the environment, sustainable and green. Must be able to function in all weather conditions.
Legal - The crossing should comply with the local road and traffic regulations/laws. Ensure there are no legal liabilities.

Stakeholders - Road users, train operators, railway maintenance workers, emergency services, general community members and legal representatives.

All these stakeholders are affected/have an effect on this system in some way.
